#Create a Python class Animal with a method make_sound() that prints "Generic animal sound". Then, create two subclasses Dog and Cat that inherit from Animal. Override the make_sound() method in each subclass to print "Woof" for Dog and "Meow" for Cat. Finally, create instances of both Dog and Cat classes and call the make_sound() method on each.

#You are building a Python application to manage a library system. Define a base class LibraryItem with a method display_info() that prints out information about the library item. Create two subclasses Book and DVD that inherit from LibraryItem. Override the display_info() method in each subclass to display specific information about the book or DVD, such as title, author, and ISBN for a book, and title, director, and duration for a DVD. Finally, create instances of both Book and DVD classes and call the display_info() method on each.

    def __init__(self, title, author, isbn):
