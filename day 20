    To manage dependencies efficiently in a Python project, we utilize pip, the Python package manager. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use pip:
    
    1. **Installing a Library**:
    To install a library, open a terminal or command prompt and use the following command:
        
        ```php
        
        pip install <library_name>
        
        ```
        
        For example, to install the requests library, you would type:
        
        ```
        pip install requests
        
        ```
        
    2. **Upgrading a Library**:
    If you want to upgrade a library to its latest version, you can use the **`-upgrade`** option with the **`install`** command:
        
        ```css
        pip install --upgrade <library_name>
        
        ```
        
        For example, to upgrade the requests library to the latest version, you would type:
        
        ```css
        pip install --upgrade requests
        
        ```
        
    3. **Uninstalling a Library**:
    If a library is no longer needed, you can uninstall it using the **`uninstall`** command:
        
        ```php
        pip uninstall <library_name>
        
        ```
        
        For example, to uninstall the requests library, you would type:
        
        ```
        
        pip uninstall requests
        
        ```
        
    4. **Virtual Environments**:
    Virtual environments are isolated Python environments that allow you to install libraries and manage dependencies separately for each project. They prevent conflicts between different projects that may require different versions of the same library.
    Here's how you can create and activate a virtual environment:
        
        ```bash
        # Create a virtual environment named 'myenv'
        python -m venv myenv
        
        # Activate the virtual environment
        # On Windows
        myenv\Scripts\activate
        # On macOS/Linux
        source myenv/bin/activate
        
        ```
        
        Once activated, any libraries installed using pip will be scoped to that virtual environment.
