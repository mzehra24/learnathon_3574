#Write a Python program that determines the price of a movie ticket based on the age and time of the show. The program should take the age and time (in 24-hour format) as inputs and use the **`match`** statement to calculate and print the ticket price according to the following rules:
#For age 0-5, the ticket is free.
# For age 6-12, the ticket is $10.
# For age 13-18, the ticket is $15.

#For shows before 12:00 PM, there is a $5 discount on the ticket.
