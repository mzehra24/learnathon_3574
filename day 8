#Write a Python program that defines a function called outer_function. Inside outer_function, declare a variable x with a value of 10. Then, define another function called inner_function inside outer_function. Inside inner_function, declare a variable y with a value of 5. Return the sum of x and y from inner_function. Finally, call outer_function and print the result.
def outer_function():
    x = 10
